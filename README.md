GBALua
======

Gameboy Advance development environment to use Lua. I had to use my serious CSI Google skills to even find this, so I figured it would be easier for other people to find if I put it on GitHub. Last I can tell, it was last updated in 2002 - 12 years ago at the time I'm writing this, and is obviously not using the newest version of Lua. I am not qualified to go through the code and figure out how to support whatever the latest version of Lua is, but maybe I will be someday.
